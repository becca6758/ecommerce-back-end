# ecommerce-back-end

## Description

Ecommerce backend is a project that uses tables that have relationships with each other to pull up and view, update, create, and delete inventory in various ways via insomnia. This project was created so it could assist the users in monitoring large inventory easily and simply by using names of products and categories as well as id numbers. Through this project I was able to showcase my skills in what I have learned regarding models, and relationships among other ORM functions.
